### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?
Yes they did prepare me especially Ales's teaching on CSS.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would definitely want to integrate a simple interactive map for the attractions and event locations. Imagine being able to click on an event and see its exact spot on a map â€“ that would be really useful. This would probably involve exploring a basic mapping API if allowed.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

What went well was the actual presentation and delivery next time I want to deliver a better project
